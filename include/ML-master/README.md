Some old Java code implementing a couple of machine learning algorithms including:

* Quick and dirty **k-nearest neighbor**.

* **k-means** algorithm using MDL for model selection.

* Implementation of **neural-nets**.

* **Gibbs sampling** algorithm to detect motifs in sequences.

* Implementation of a **Genetic Algorithm** solving the 8 queens problem. 

* Greedy **agglomerative clustering** with basic graphing.

* An experiment with **evolutionary neural-nets**.

* Implementation of **Ensemble Selection** (shotgun)
